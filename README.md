# TemplateUnity
Basic Template Project for Unity

This is a basic starting point for a project in Unity. I've developed this to speed up getting into actually testing a
game. It's supposed to be scalable, and easy-ish to use. Feel free to use this for literally anything, no credit necessary.
If I've done anything poorly (I probably have), please let me know how I've royally screwed up and need to fix something.
I want to continue improving on this with generic systems as time goes on and as I build more games, and I will drop those
here. 

Thank you for checking this out, and I hope it helps you skip a bunch a work getting started out. Please let me know if
anything needs changes, or if you have a request for a feature that I can throw in here.
